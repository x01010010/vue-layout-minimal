# Project Creation Components

This directory contains all components related to the project creation form interface.

## Structure

- `steps/` - Individual step components for the multi-step form
  - `StepProjectBasics.vue` - Step 1: Project name, type, description, and tags âœ…
  - `StepDatabaseConfig.vue` - Step 2: Database configuration and connection âœ…
  - `StepReviewExecute.vue` - Step 4: Review & Execute project creation âœ…
- `HorizontalStepper.vue` - Horizontal stepper navigation component (to be implemented)
- `ProjectCreationForm.vue` - Main form orchestrator component (to be implemented)
- `DraftRestorationModal.vue` - Modal for restoring saved drafts (to be implemented)

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components âœ…
- **Step 1: Project Basics** - Full implementation with validation
- **Step 2: Database Configuration** - Complete database setup with connection testing
- **Step 4: Review & Execute** - Comprehensive review and project creation execution

### Pending Components ðŸš§
- **Step 3: Parameters** - Dynamic parameter configuration (planned)
- **Horizontal Stepper Navigation** - Visual step navigation component
- **Main Form Orchestrator** - Central form management component
- **Draft Restoration Modal** - Save/restore draft functionality

## Current Integration

The project creation form is currently integrated into `ProjectCreationView.vue` with:
- Horizontal stepper navigation using Vuetify's `v-stepper`
- Individual step components rendered conditionally
- Full Pinia store integration for state management
- Real-time validation and progress tracking

## Key Features Implemented

### Step 4: Review & Execute (Latest Addition)
- **Comprehensive Data Review**: All collected project data displayed in organized sections
- **Inline Editing**: Quick edit capabilities with navigation to previous steps
- **Project Creation Execution**: Mock API simulation with progress tracking
- **Export Functionality**: Download configuration in JSON, YAML, or ENV formats
- **Validation Status**: Real-time validation feedback and error reporting
- **Success/Error Handling**: Complete user feedback system
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

### Technical Architecture
- **Vue 3 Composition API** with TypeScript
- **Vuetify 3** component library for consistent UI
- **Pinia Store** integration for centralized state management
- **Type Safety** with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- **Validation System** with real-time feedback
- **Mock API** simulation for development and testing

## Architecture

Based on the specifications in `PROJECT_CREATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`, these components follow a modular design pattern with:

- Horizontal stepper navigation
- Individual step components for each form section
- Draft persistence and restoration
- Real-time validation and progress tracking
- Integration with the project creation Pinia store

## Development Notes

The implementation follows the Baby Stepsâ„¢ methodology, with each component being:
1. Fully implemented with comprehensive features
2. Thoroughly tested and validated
3. Properly documented
4. Integrated with the existing architecture

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for the complete project creation workflow, with Step 4 serving as the culmination of the user experience.
